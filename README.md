# Journey-to-Coding
I am currently an accountant starting a journey teaching myself to code....! 

Welcome,

My name is Seth Parker and I am currently an accounting and finance professional (5 years of experience). I lead a team of five and enjoy setting goals and attacking them.  I started teaching myself to code in September 2018. I enjoy the challenge of learning something new and building something. I am interested in SaaS and PaaS business structures. I am looking to take on side projects and build my confidence/understanding of coding. Personally, I learn the most by challenging myself and failing until I find the answer, for that reason coding has seemed to be the perfect fit for me. 

I am working toward becoming a product/project manager. I believe with my background in accounting and finance I will be great at defining the project, building a team, staying on top of deadlines and under budget. Being a product manager means you can balance a lot at once and I have proven I can do that. Building a great product means listening to customers, building a great team, understanding the stakeholders, staying focused and building something everyone can be passionate about. 

I am planning to start a website and blog to talk about my journey. I am new to the coding world, but I always want to help people so with that being said I want this journey to be public (the good and bad), I want to be an inspiration and I want to lift others up along the way to live their dreams as well. My first project will be building a personal website with a blog and pictures.  If anyone wants to chat about ideas, please reach out.

I am open to any suggestions, readings, conferences and videos you are open to sharing. You can contact me here or via email at sethparker910@gmail.com . 

I might not know all the answers now, but I know the right questions to ask to get me there ðŸ˜Š 

Thanks, 

Seth Parker
